I am an theoretical physics student a Imperial College London. My interest research area is quantum information science, with a focus on quantum information theory and quantum cryptography. I am interested in connections to mathematical physics, most importantly through the fields of matrix analysis and topology. I am also very interested in Philosophy, Art and History, you can find some of my articles in the Blog section.
